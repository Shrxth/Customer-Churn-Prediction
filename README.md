# 🔍 ChurnVision: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

In today's hyper-competitive digital landscape, customer retention is more critical than ever. This project presents a data-driven approach to identifying customers who are at risk of churning—leaving the service. By leveraging powerful machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model that can anticipate churn behavior, allowing businesses to take proactive steps toward enhancing loyalty, improving satisfaction, and reducing customer attrition.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn results in substantial financial losses and decreased market presence. Our goal is to:
- Predict churn based on historical customer behavior.
- Empower businesses to deploy targeted retention strategies.
- Optimize resource allocation by identifying high-risk segments.
- Boost customer lifetime value by improving satisfaction and engagement.

This solution contributes directly to strategic decision-making and customer relationship management.
